# Modulo-14-UP_DOWN-COUNTER
ðŸ”¢ Modulo-14 Loadable Asynchronous Up-Down Counter
This project implements a Modulo-14 Loadable Asynchronous Up-Down Counter using SystemVerilog. The counter is designed to count from 0 to 13 in both upward and downward directions, based on a control signal. It features:

Asynchronous operation: Clock-independent transitions
Up/Down functionality: Controlled by a single direction signal
Load capability: Allows setting the counter to any value within the range
Reset support: Asynchronous reset to clear the counter
ðŸ“‚ Features
Written in SystemVerilog for RTL-level simulation
Testbench included for basic functionality verification
Suitable for use in digital design, VLSI verification, or FPGA projects
Can be extended for higher modulos or synchronous design
ðŸš€ Applications
Digital timers
Frequency dividers
Finite state machines (FSMs)
Custom counting circuits in VLSI designs
